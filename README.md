# Task-Queueing-API-NodeJS  

A scalable and efficient task queueing system built using **Node.js**, designed to handle user-specific rate limiting and task queuing. This project demonstrates advanced concepts in API design, task management, and rate limiting.  

## Features  

- **Rate Limiting**:  
  - Allows one task per second per user.  
  - Permits up to 20 tasks per minute per user.  
- **Task Queueing**:  
  - Tasks exceeding the rate limit are queued and processed sequentially.  
- **Clustered Node.js Environment**:  
  - Deployed with two Node.js replicas for scalability.  
- **Logging**:  
  - Tracks task completions and stores logs in files for monitoring.  
- **Queue Management**:  
  - Smooth handling of concurrent requests while maintaining system performance.  

## Technologies Used  

- **Node.js**: Backend runtime environment.  
- **Express**: Lightweight web application framework.  
- **Rate Limiting Libraries**: For implementing request throttling.  
- **File System (FS)**: For logging task completions.  

## How It Works  

1. **API Requests**: Users send requests to the API.  
2. **Rate Limiter**: Checks if the user has exceeded their allowed rate.  
3. **Queue System**:  
   - If the user is within their rate limit, the task is processed immediately.  
   - If not, the task is queued for later execution.  
4. **Task Processing**: Tasks are executed sequentially, respecting the rate limits.  
5. **Logging**: Each completed task is logged into a file.  

## Setup Instructions  

1. **Clone the Repository**:  
   ```bash  
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/Task-Queueing-API-NodeJS.git  
   cd Task-Queueing-API-NodeJS  
   ```  

2. **Install Dependencies**:  
   ```bash  
   npm install  
   ```  

3. **Run the Application**:  
   ```bash  
   npm start  
   ```  

4. **Testing the API**:  
   Use tools like **Postman** or **cURL** to send API requests and observe behavior.  

## API Endpoints  

- `POST /task`  
  - Adds a new task to the queue.  
  - Returns status of the task (processed or queued).

## Future Enhancements  

- Implement distributed task queues for larger systems.  
- Add real-time monitoring for queued and completed tasks.  
- Support dynamic rate limit configurations per user.
